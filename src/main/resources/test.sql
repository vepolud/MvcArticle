INSERT INTO ARTICLE (id, article_header,  article_text) VALUES (1,'Why Do Cats Purr When You Stroke Them?','If you’re wondering why your cat purrs when she’s stroked, it’s likely because she’s feeling relaxed. If she purrs when she’s being held or around a stranger, she could be feeling anxious.

Cats may even purr to help themselves rest or repair injuries. This is why your cat may purr when giving birth or in distress. If you notice a change in your cat’s behavior combined with unusual purring, this could be a sign that your cat is in pain and should see a veterinarian.

A high-pitched mixture of purring and meowing is what experts call a “solicitation purr.” It likely means she wants attention or food.

“Studies have demonstrated the ‘solicitation purr’ is most used by adult cats and directed toward humans to solicit food,” says Dr. Annie Valuska, Ph.D. “This purr has a high frequency voiced component within it that human participants consistently judged as more urgent and less pleasant than a ‘normal’ purr.

“The frequencies of this ‘voiced peak’ correspond to those of human infant distress cries, which could explain why they are so easily perceived by humans as urgent.”

You may hear your cat use this particular purr to communicate she’s ready for her next meal.  ');
